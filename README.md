## Frontend celebrity recognition

Web application built with React, Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL that uses an artificial intelligence web API to recognize the faces of celebrities around the world. By entering the URL of an image it detects the face, frames it and provides the name of the celebrity.

The rest of the project made with node.js and express.js is on Heroku:
